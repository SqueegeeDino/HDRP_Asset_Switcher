# SXL_Map_Patch
Various map utilities

Current features:
Map Script Support
HDRP Asset Switching (EXPERIMENTAL)

Press F9 to load custom HDRP Asset 
Press F11 to return to default HDRP Asset

The asset switching feature is experimental, buggy, and can hurt performance. ***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***
Current cstom HDRP Asset supports decals and SSR, as well as using slightly higher quality shadow settings. 


Credits:

Amatobahn for making the HDRP Asset.
Bill for his open source code I lifted from Bill-O-Rumble
Mcbtay for an insane amount of help, basically writing half the mod, and ongoing support of the mods development
